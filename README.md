# ClosedZeppelin
`ClosedZeppelin` is a smart contract project created using `Hardhat` that provides identity management functionality for other smart contracts. The main goal of the project is to make it easy for developers to embed the identity module inside their contracts and let ClosedZeppelin handle the identities of the users.

With ClosedZeppelin, developers can easily override the `_msgSender` function and allow ClosedZeppelin to manage the identities of the users. This ensures that users will never have to worry about the loss of their keys, and all their identities are managed by ClosedZeppelin.

## Features
Identity management functionality for other smart contracts
Easy to embed in other smart contracts
Secure admin key management using multiple Ledger Nano wallets
Handles identities of users so they never have to worry about key losses

## Getting Started
To get started with ClosedZeppelin, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies using npm install.
3. Run the tests using npm run test.
4. Deploy the smart contract to your preferred blockchain network.

Once you have deployed the smart contract, you can integrate it into your own smart contracts by overriding the _msgSender function.

## Admin Key Management
ClosedZeppelin uses multiple `Ledger Nano` wallets to manage the admin keys. These wallets are distributed in different parts of the world to ensure maximum security. The admin keys are kept in separate wallets, and each wallet contains two times the maximum cluster size of signers.

## Conclusion
ClosedZeppelin is a powerful smart contract project that provides `identity` management functionality for other smart contracts. It's easy to embed and use, and ensures that users never have to worry about the loss of their keys. The secure admin key management using multiple Ledger Nano wallets ensures maximum security for the project.
